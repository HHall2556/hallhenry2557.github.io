                    <p>gatesnfences.com is a website for selling and installing fences 
                        in residential areas in Florida. Virtually any gate type.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Contrast:</strong> All the text is readable. On the menu on the 
                            left side of the screen they outlined the menu items but
                            some of the items are too long and go outside the borders. On
                            The borders, there is white on light gray text making it difficult to read.
                            The colors in general are all over the place too.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Repetition:</strong> The pages are consistent, but within each page, there is 
                            little repetion between where headers go, what colors are links, or in that menu,
                            some have different outlines which make it look like a heading, but they aren't sometimes. 
                            Some of the picture change when you hober them, and some don't. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment on this page is all over the place. The 
                            page seems contained, but, the search bar on the right sticks
                            out. It feels like everything was thrown on the page. Some 
                            items are just off center, like the 'Dealers Application' at the bottom.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Proximity:</strong> Most of the text boxes lacks a header
                            or an easy way to identify what is even being talked about without
                            reading the whole thing. Looking back, the header might actually 
                            be to the left of the text so I was confused. I can't tell. 
                        </li>

                    <h3><a href="https://slack.com/">Slack.com</a></h3>
                    <p>Slack is googles take on a team communication service. It is 
                       for everyone, but I think it is more for the business market than
                       discord for example. 
                    </p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Contrast:</strong> All the text is very easy to read. The headings are
                            obvious and the buttons use distinct colors. Different macro sections use different 
                            background colors to make it more obvious. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Repetition:</strong> Throughout the page everything is formatted consistently.
                            Header, followed by subtext, with links underneath and picutres wrapping the text on
                            either side. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Everything is in alignemnt on the page with nothing sticking
                            out awkwardly. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Proximity:</strong> It is extremely obvious what belongs with what because only
                            relevant information is grouped together. Pictures relate directly to text around them. 
                            The subtext relates directly to the heading it is under. 
                        </li>
