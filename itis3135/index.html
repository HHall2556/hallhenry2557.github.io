                <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I grew up in California, 
                    saw the writing on the wall, and joined the mass exodus from the state. 
                    North Carolina is a breath of fresh air.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have been working since I was 
                    16(7 years), in both team member and leadership roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> First I studied at University of California: 
                    Irvine mainly doing general ed. After taking a year off school, 
                    I joined UNCC as a computer Science Major. I am specializing in 
                    Cyber Security.</li>
                <li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> I have done a project in another 
                    class that used some HTML. Already, this course is infinitely better</li>
                <li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Desktop PC. Windows is the 
                    best platform for gaming. I do have a separate partition for linux. </li> 
                <li><strong>Courses I'm taking and Why:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>ITCS 3160 - Database Deseign & Implementation: Databases are 
                            where we store information. Very useful course.</li>
                        <li>ITIS 3135 - Web App Deseign and Development: My favorite 
                            course this semester. Not a waste of time.</li>
                        <li>ITSC 3688 - Computers & Their Impact on Society: 
                            Complete waste of time but mandatory.</li>
                        <li>STAT 2022 - Intro to Statistics and Probability: I wish I took 
                            this before Logic. The professor is old fashioned. 
                            There is lying and then there is statistics.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>    
                <li><strong>Interesting Fact about me:</strong> I tend to like the classics.
                     Musically, I mostly enjoy 60s-80s for rock and metal. 80s-90s for rap. 
                     I've been playing Counter Strike for 10 years. 
                     Starcraft: Broodwar is better than SC2. 
                     Battlefront 2(2005) is better than the new one by DICE.</li>
                <li><strong>I'd also like to share this:</strong> Being a purist, I also prefer 
                    reading the books to the movie adaptations. 
                    For Example: Enders game, Game of Thrones, Jurassic Park, 
                    The Godfather, and Lord of the Rings are all better books than 
                    movies/shows even if the film adaptions are good. </li>
