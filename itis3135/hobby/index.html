                <p>Counter-Strike: Global offensive(CS:GO or just CS) is a <strong>5</strong>
                    vs <strong>5</strong> objective based first person shooter(FPS).</p>
                <p>CS:GO was released August 12th, 2012 so this year is the 10th anniversry.
                     However, Counter-Strike as a franchise has been around since 1999, so
                     it has been as massive force and influence on the industry for as long as 
                     I have been alive. 
                </p>
                <p>Compared to some of its contemporaries, CS is smaller, more constrained, and simple.
                    Simultaneously, it is a game with infinite depth and replayability. 
                </p>
                <p>Counter-Strike's gameplay loop is easy to watch, but very difficult to master. This makes it perfectly suited for Esports, which is why it
                    has remained a dominant and heavily popular game in that scene.
                </p>
                <p>It is a game I have close to 3,000 hours in, and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.
                    I have yet to find another FPS that can replace the way CS:GO makes me feel. I hope that after
                    viewing this site, you too can understand the passion and love I still have for this rich game.

                        <h3>Half Life Mod</h3>
                        <p>Counter-strike does not start with the first game in the series. It
                            acutally starts with a game called Half Life released in 1998 by Valve. You
                            play as Gordan Freeman, a scientist who needs to escape the Black Mesa
                            Research Facility after it is invaded by aliens. You explore, solve puzzles, 
                            and fight aliens and the military trying to contain the event. This game is considered
                            a master peice, maintaining a 96% positive rating on the game over two decades later. 
                            Fans of the game created a mod of Half Life that used the source engine that powered
                            the single player game to create a multiplayer experience. This mod was so popular that 
                            Counter-Strike became a game. <br> This aspect of its creation is part of what makes CS
                            so unique. CS is a game that came from the community, and the community is the heart of the game

                        <p>
                            Obviously, the first release was version 1.0, but when referring to this game now,
                            1.6 is the ubiquitous term. This was the first official game released and the game
                            that many Counter Strike purists look back on as the best entry in the franchise.
                            It has the classic maps and was very heavily focused on the community just having fun.
                            I was 1 years old when this game was released in 2000, so I never played it, but
                            the influence of this game can be seen in other aspects such as meme culture. The radio 
                            commands from this game are goofy and wonderful.

                        <p>
                            Counter Strike: Source (CS:S) was the next major update in 2004. CS: Conditon Zero (CS:CZ) is described 
                            as very similar to 1.6 but with content updates like adding bots and a single player campaign.
                            We are skipping it since most players didn't stop play 1.6 for CS:CZ. 
                            Source is somewhat divisive and nowadays is also played much less than 1.6. AVG player counts for
                            Source are aroud 3.5k while 1.6 has about 10k players each month. <br> However, Source is important
                            because it was a massive update that dramatically changed the feel of Counter Strike.
                            The physiscs were changed for player movement, grenades, and the graphics received a massive overhaul.
                            I actually got this game to play garry's mod and only use it for surfing occaisonally.

                        <p>
                            In 2012, Valve Finally got around to the next major Counter Strike update: Counter Strike: Global Offensive(CS:GO)
                            The graphics received a massive overhaul to make the game look much more presentable than
                            an obviously early 2000s game. Graphics aren't everything, but this game was the newest when
                            I first started getting into PC gaming around 2010-2011 for games like Starcraft 2 and Minecraft.
                            CS:GO has seen many updates in the past ten years, and in many ways is a much different game than launch, some good
                            some bad. CS:GO is the game official supported by Valve and is the platform that is used for competition among the 
                            best players in the world. It is a game I usually play at least once a week, despite the fact that I am washed up.

                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>
                    The gameplay for Counter Strike is simply unparralled by other FPS games.
                    CS:GO has so much depth to it. Winning a match is so much deeper than having
                    the highest amount of points, or clicking faster than others. 
                </p>
